As a data science major, I have spent most of my college years becoming proficient in Python and R. The great programming languages have given me necessary experience for my future career. However, these are not the only programming languages loved by data scientists. Here is a short list of the 5 programming languages I believe to be the most popular.

## 1. Python

* Python uses a clear syntax via whitespace that enables beginner to to quickly pick up  the skills necessary to proficiently read and write it.

* An extensive and well-developed library of modules and packages reduces the need to write code from scratch

* Acts as a general purpose language, meaning it has applications in a variety of fields. This also means that programming written by a data scientist in Python can be easily understood by people in different industries

* The Python community is expansive and easily accessible when help is needed. There is a vast trove of resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help with any project

* Python is free to access and distribute. This makes it accessible to a wide range of developers.

For more information on Python, see [The Python Website](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)


## 2. R

* R is best known for its libraries designed for statistical analysis. It allows use of many statistical tests and models that data scientists often use.

* R provides expansive data visualization abilities. It enables you to create high-quality and complex graphs to describe data in a variety of ways.

* R, like Python, is open source, meaning it is free to access by anyone. This allows for a broad community of support and enables easy classroom access.

* Easily fulfills the purposes of exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning for data scientists.

* R enables easy reproduction of research because you can create files that capture all of the steps taken to analyze data. This is a big benefit to data science research and beyond.

## 3. SQL

* This is an easy to use langauage because of its declarative nature. You can easily tell it what you need it to do without telling it how to do it.

* Is most useful when querying data. It uses built in statement to allow the user to quickly move through the data and extract meaningful insights.

* SQL is standardized, meaning it has a high level of compatability between different databases. The syntax may change slightly across databases, but the core language stays the same.

* Is known for having high data security and data integrity, meaning that keys are used to maintain the quality and consistency of the data.

* Supports the creation of structured data models through tables.

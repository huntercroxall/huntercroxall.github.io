As a data science major, I have spent most of my college years becoming proficient in Python and R. The great programming languages have given me necessary experience for my future career. However, these are not the only programming languages loved by data scientists. Here is a short list of the 5 programming languages I believe to be the most popular.

## 1. Python

* Python uses a clear syntax via whitespace that enables beginner to to quickly pick up  the skills necessary to proficiently read and write it.

* An extensive and well-developed library of modules and packages reduces the need to write code from scratch

* Acts as a general purpose language, meaning it has applications in a variety of fields. This also means that programming written by a data scientist in Python can be easily understood by people in different industries

* The Python community is expansive and easily accessible when help is needed. There is a vast trove of resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help with any project

* Python is free to access and distribute. This makes it accessible to a wide range of developers.

For more information on Python, see [The Python Website](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

## 2. R

* R is best known for its libraries designed for statistical analysis. It allows use of many statistical tests and models that data scientists often use.

* R provides expansive data visualization abilities. It enables you to create high-quality and complex graphs to describe data in a variety of ways.

* R, like Python, is open source, meaning it is free to access by anyone. This allows for a broad community of support and enables easy classroom access.

* Easily fulfills the purposes of exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning for data scientists.

* R enables easy reproduction of research because you can create files that capture all of the steps taken to analyze data. This is a big benefit to data science research and beyond.

For more information on R see [The R Website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)

## 3. SQL

* This is an easy to use langauage because of its declarative nature. You can easily tell it what you need it to do without telling it how to do it.

* Is most useful when querying data. It uses built in statement to allow the user to quickly move through the data and extract meaningful insights.

* SQL is standardized, meaning it has a high level of compatability between different databases. The syntax may change slightly across databases, but the core language stays the same.

* Is known for having high data security and data integrity, meaning that keys are used to maintain the quality and consistency of the data.

* Supports the creation of structured data models through tables.

## 4. Java

* Java was designed for reliability, meaning it uses features like automatic memory management to prevent many of the most common programming errors

* Platform independence enables Java to be written once and run from anywhere. This reduces the need for platform-specific development

* Has a well-maintained source of official documentation, as well as a strong and active community that provides any resource a beginner may want.

* Has support for multithreading, which makes it suitable for applications that need parallel processing and multitask completion.

* Innovated through an open source project. This enable language evolution as data science continues to transform into the future.

## 5. SAS

* SAS is known for powerful analytics and a wide range of tools for data mining, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

* Enables efficient preparation of data scraped from the internet.

* Has high-quality data visualization capabitilites that all for the creation of professional graphs, reports, and charts.

* Has an international and highly-professional community (since one must pay to use this program) making it perfect for large organizations and international operations.

* Is designed for business analytics, meaning it has reliable capabilities in analyzing customer data through a variety of means.

Whether you hope to get a job in data science, or just had a curiosity about programming langauges, I hope that this post has given you some insights. Four out of the five languages described above are free to access. If you have any interest in trying any of them out, the websites I provided should give you directions on how to install each of them.

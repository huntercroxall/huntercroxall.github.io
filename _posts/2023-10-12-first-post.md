As a data science major, I have spent most of my college years becoming proficient in Python and R. The great programming languages have given me necessary experience for my future career. However, these are not the only programming languages loved by data scientists. Here is a short list of the 5 programming languages I believe to be the most popular.

## 1. Python

* Python uses a clear syntax via whitespace that enables beginner to to quickly pick up  the skills necessary to proficiently read and write it.

* An extensive and well-developed library of modules and packages reduces the need to write code from scratch

* Acts as a general purpose language, meaning it has applications in a variety of fields. This also means that programming written by a data scientist in Python can be easily understood by people in different industries

* The Python community is expansive and easily accessible when help is needed. There is a vast trove of resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help with any project

* Python is free to access and distribute. This makes it accessible to a wide range of developers.


2. R

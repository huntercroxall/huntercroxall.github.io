## Introduction:
For my Stat 386 project, I chose to use an API Key to access the OpenFDA database. The FDA, or Food and Drug Administration, of the United
States Government records data on a variety of foods, drugs, and devices. The OpenFDA database allows the public to access this data and
complete analysis on a variety of aspects of this data. For the sake of this blog post, I decided to gather data regarding recalls of various
foods. This blog post will describe the process used to gather the data using the OpenFDA API.
